Menu manager enables you to manage blog menu very easy.
You can add Pages, Categories, and Custom Link into your blog menu.
You can manage the menu structure into a dropdown tree menu with whatever structure you like.

Features :
* Select Pages and Categories as your menu
* Create new custom menu
* Manage menu structure
* Dropdown tree menu
* If you want to customize the styles/menu-manager.css stylesheet, you can place it in your active theme folder, and Menu Manager will find it there (that way you won't lose your stylesheet customizations when upgrading Menu Manager).
